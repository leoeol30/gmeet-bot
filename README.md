# üé• Gladia Transcription - GMeet Bot

<div align="center">

*A technical implementation demonstrating Gladia's real-time and prerecorded transcription APIs with Google Meet*


</div>

A demonstration showing how to use both Gladia's real-time and prerecorded transcription APIs with Google Meet. The project supports two modes:
- Real-time transcription with live output during the meeting
- Prerecorded transcription with speaker diarization after the meeting

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is a technical demonstration and not intended for production use.

## üîë Key Technical Aspects
- Dual transcription modes (real-time and prerecorded)
- Integration with Gladia's V2 APIs
- Virtual audio capture for Google Meet
- Automated session management

## üöÄ Build Options

```bash
# Real-time Transcription Mode
docker build -t gmeet-live -f Dockerfile.live .

# Prerecorded Transcription Mode
docker build -t gmeet-prerecorded -f Dockerfile.prerecorded .
```
